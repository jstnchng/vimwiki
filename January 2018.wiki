=== Debugging ===
* Understand how the service works
* Identify theories
* Figure out how to test your theory, and validate
* It is important to have a plan!
=== ECS ===
* service = what tasks to run, roles, load balancing, auto-scaling, health check, aggregate metrics
* tasks = how to run this image
  - has task def, describes everything about running an image
  - task def has container definition, describes containers that form your application
  - can run multiple containers in a task
* container/image = docker terms
* cluster = cluster of boxes
* Everything in ECS built off of EC2 instances
  - ECS runs docker on EC2 instances
* Service + Task def = what I want to run and how to run it
* services are run on instances
