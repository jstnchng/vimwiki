* I think a manager should be able to answer these 6 questions:
  - What are my goals, both long term and short term?
  - What am I focused on getting better at?
  - What are my areas of strength?
  - What are my areas of weakness?
  - How have I improved?
  - How have I contributed?

* DNS: maps hostnames to IPs
* ALB: static IP for IPs that might change (multiple services that spin up)
* Proxy: caller -> proxy -> service, then service -> proxy -> caller
  Redirect: caller -> redirect, redirect -> caller (tells the caller what to redirect to), caller -> service
* SSL on top of HTTPS, concept of handshake
