== Ch 1 ==
* DW/BI systems driven from the needs of business users
* Information is used for
  - operational record keeping
  - analytical decision making
* Put data in operational systems, take data out in DW/BI systems
* Operational systems:
  - deal w 1 transactional record at a time
  - optimized to do the same task
  - do not maintain history
* DW/BI systems:
  - optimized for w high performance queries
  - save historical context
* DW/BI requirements:
  * make information easily accessible
  * present consistent data
  * adapt to change
  * present data fast
  * secure access level controls
  * source of truth
=== 3NF Models ===
* 3NF models seek to remove data redundancies
  divide data into discrete entities, each of which becomes a relational table
  also known as ER models (entity relation)
* Difference between 3NF and dim models is *degree of normalization*
* 3NF structures are useful for operational processing bc update/inserts happen in only 1 table
=== Fact Tables ===
* Fact table in a dimensional model stores the performance measurements resulting from an org's business processing events
* Fact represents a business measure
  * each row in a fact table is a measurement event
  * a measurement event in the physical world has a 1-1 relationship with a single row in the corresponding fact table
* Useful facts are additive/multiplicative, bc often many facts are retrieved at once
* Textual information should be a dimension, often a description drawing from a discrete list of values, not a measured fact (continuous)
* All fact tables have 2 or more FKs connecting them to dim table's primary keys. If all FKs match respective PKs in the dim table, tables satisfy *referential integrity*.
* Fact tables have a PK, subset of its FKs, called the *composite key*. Every table w a CK is a fact table. Fact tables express many-to-many relationships. All other are dimension tables.
=== Dim Tables ===
* contain the textual context associated w a business measurement event
  who what when where why how of an event
* Dim tables tend to have less depth but more width than fact tables
* Have 1 PK
* Dimension attributes serve as primary source of query constraints, groupings, and report labels.
  identify attributes with "by" keyword- find x by price, price must be a dim
* The analytic power of the DW/BI environment is directly proportional to the quality and depth of the dimension attributes
* Is this data a fact or a dimension?
  * Fact if: takes on a lot of values, participates in calculations
  * Dim if: discretely valued description, more of less constant, participates in constraints & row labels
* Continuously valued numeric quantities are often facts, discrete numeric observations are often dim attributes
* Dim tables should not be too normalized, they are often smaller than fact tables and improving efficiency there is not that helpful
=== Star Schemas ===
* Dim model: fact table surrounded by relevant dim tables (star structure)
* Simple schemas can be queried w fewer joins more efficiently
* Most granular/atomic data has the most dimensions
* Dimensional models can be extended gracefully- can add new dims as long as that value is defined for existing fact rows, can add new facts as long as their level of detail is consistent w existing fact table

* Q: What is an olap cube versus a star schema
* Q: What is the difference between a fact and a measure?
* Dimension is the context associated w/ business process measurement event
  Provide entry points to the data
  Dimensions = reports' filters and labeling, facts = numeric values
  Dimensions can be added as long as atomic data is the foundation
* Q: ETL from source to backroom. what brings backroom to frontroom?
* Q: what is enterprise bus architecture
