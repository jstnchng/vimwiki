* What does it mean to own something? What levels of ownership are there?
* There are a couple: owning your work, owning your team, owning your product
* Ownership means many different complicated things, means being accountable/ responsible for the value you are shipping and the product with which you are providing value
* Ownership means owning your own career, being accountable for your growth and seeking help where you need it
* Ownership means on a granular level just owning your own work, driving it even if you need help
* Separating the dual problem of not asking enough questions versus asking too many questions
  - key distinction b/w "dumb" questions and lazy questions
* Owning what you do, shift into being accountable for what you're doing, and thinking about how you can drive it to success
* Sometimes working with great people means it's easy to let things slide and when you get errors think OK they will help me figure it out
* But really... ownership means to own what you're doing, think cogently about what it is you want to accomplish, and making the distinction between being tired and being blocked
* other aspects of ownership: owning your product, wearing the hats of other roles on your team, thinking about design, thinking about user experience, thinking about when something is really delivering value, owning the whole stack of your work/value
  - doesn't mean do it all... can mean you own it by having other people own it
